    "For this dataset, we utilized a sample of houses to model similarly priced houses to determine a prediction mechanism for houses. By analyzing features of the images, we are able to detect several components that parallel between several houses. Using this information gives us a recommendation engine for future houses. Home search applications, such as Zillow, Apartments.com, and Trulia can view similar houses that customers browse to identify the best possible recommendation beyond just statistical data. Prediction accuracy relies on the features that we can detect within the images of houses. For our purposes, we only utilized the pixel information, but in the future we would prefer to incorporate other statistical data of the properties for our model. Features like window count, exterior color, column presence, architectural style, can all be detected utilizing the comparison model to come up with a recurrent algorithm to also predict price. Then we can create a user recommended profile based upon similar features within a given price range for a fully customized and catered customer experience."
